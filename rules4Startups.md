1. Don't waste your investor's money, or nobody will ever give you money again.

2. Founders work harder and longer than their employees. Period.

3. Help fellow entrepreneurs when they ask for your help or advice. The world is built on good Karma.

4. Listen to the critics, ignore the haters. There are always haters.

5. Anything you put in a deck and email outside of your domain will find its way to your competitors, period.

6. be positive!  California is the land of sunshine and tulip crazes.  Google and Tesla proved that anything's possible.  There are no "problems" only "challenges" and no challenges only "opportunities"!   (as a displaced New Yorker, this is hard for me, even after 20 years out here)

7. don't name competitors esp in the press: only feeds them leads.  When pressed, say that you can't comment on "other companies" because "you don't know their offering well enough to do them justice."

8. only the paranoid survive... but avoid paranoia.  Any good idea will be copied within 18 months by 3 companies.  But remember that trulty world class execution is pretty rare, and most other teams will screw up somehow.  Of course, so will you.

9. be respectful.  There's a lot of idiots and wannabes, but they sometimes turn out to be key later.  You never know.

10. think big, don't be petty.  The valley respects big ideas and amazing execution.  Pettiness gets you flagged as one of them.

11. take time for personal fun and inspiration.  There'll always be terror and stress but you need to make time for fun, whatever your idea of that is.
