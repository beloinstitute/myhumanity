#### Silicon Valley Culture

 Some few lessons for Silicon Savannah

"Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th."
J. Andrews

Gigi Wang, a member from VLAB (Venture Lab), a collaboration between MIT and Stanford to help fund start-up companies here in Silicon Valley has   talked about some key components that fosters success in the Valley. These qualities are:
 1. **Trust:** openness and transparency
 2. **Risk Taking:** failure is GOOD
 3. **Integrity:** win-win-win
 4. **Collaboration:** networking is key
 5. **Accessibility:** leaders open and available
 6. **Constructive Feedback:** get good at it, donâ€™t be defensive
 7. **Empowerment:** innovation from the bottom is chaotic but produces mega-success
 8. **Share the Wealth:** equitable pay, everyone has skin in the game
 9. **(lack of) Jealousy:** be happy for others who do well


 
**Net net**
An eco system is made up of talent, resources, and other firms.  Having them close at hand makes things more efficient.  You can schedule a meeting for tomorrow at their office and not have to spend time flying.  If something needs to be delivered urgently, you can just drop it off.
And then that kicks off a virtuous cycle: once the beneficial eco system is established, everyone will want to be part of it.  Talent, financing, and technology accumulate here.
