 1. **Trust:** openness and transparency
 2. **Risk Taking:** failure is GOOD
 3. **Integrity:** win-win-win
 4. **Collaboration:** networking is key
 5. **Accessibility:** leaders open and available
 6. **Constructive Feedback:** get good at it, don’t be defensive
 7. **Empowerment:** innovation from the bottom is chaotic but produces mega-success
 8. **Share the Wealth:** equitable pay, everyone has skin in the game
